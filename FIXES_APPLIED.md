# Fixes Applied

## 1. Fixed ScrollReveal Animations

### Issue:

Scroll-triggered animations were not working properly.

### Fix Applied:

- Removed `typeof window !== "undefined"` check from GSAP registration
- Fixed GSAP ScrollTrigger registration to be unconditional: `gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);`
- Added proper implementation example in `src/pages/Home.jsx` for the IntroBlocks section
- The ScrollReveal component is now properly imported and used

### Test:

Navigate to the homepage and scroll down to the "Why Choose Doulos?" section. The title should fade in first, followed by the three cards animating in sequence.

## 2. Fixed Light Mode Functionality

### Issue:

When toggling to light mode, only the scrollbar changed color, but the rest of the website remained in dark mode.

### Fix Applied:

- Added `darkMode: 'class'` configuration to the Tailwind plugin in `vite.config.js`
- This ensures Tailwind CSS 4 properly recognizes the `.dark` class on the HTML element
- Restarted the development server to apply the configuration changes

### Test:

1. The website should default to dark mode
2. Click the theme toggle button (sun/moon icon) in the navigation
3. The entire website should switch between light and dark themes properly

## 3. Tailwind CSS 4 Configuration

### Issue:

Tailwind CSS 4 requires explicit dark mode configuration.

### Fix Applied:

- Updated `vite.config.js` to pass `darkMode: 'class'` option to the Tailwind plugin
- Kept the CSS configuration minimal as requested (no `tailwind.config.js` file)
- Used the official Tailwind CSS 4 with Vite approach from the documentation

## Files Modified:

1. **`src/hooks/useScrollReveal.js`**:

   - Fixed GSAP registration
   - Removed debugging console logs

2. **`src/pages/Home.jsx`**:

   - Added ScrollReveal import
   - Replaced framer-motion animations with ScrollReveal in IntroBlocks section

3. **`vite.config.js`**:

   - Added `darkMode: 'class'` configuration to Tailwind plugin

4. **`src/index.css`**:
   - Kept minimal, only the `@import "tailwindcss";` directive

## Development Server:

- Running at: `http://localhost:5175/`
- Server restarted to apply configuration changes
- No compilation errors

## Usage Example:

```jsx
import ScrollReveal from '../components/ScrollReveal';

// Single element animation
<ScrollReveal>
  <h2>This will fade in when scrolled into view</h2>
</ScrollReveal>

// Staggered animation for multiple children
<ScrollReveal stagger={true} staggerDelay={0.15}>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
    <Card>Card 1</Card>
    <Card>Card 2</Card>
    <Card>Card 3</Card>
  </div>
</ScrollReveal>
```

Both the scroll animations and light mode toggle should now be working properly.
