I've made tables manually in my database, check the #doulostheologicalseminary.sql file
for the structure and relationships. take a look at it and make necessary changes to the ApplicationForm.jsx and wherever needed to ensure that the application data is stored correctly in the database.
Also, ensure that the form validation is in place and that the data is being sent to the server correctly.

read the #config.php for any details and setup you need to do.

Make sure to add all the safety checks and validations to ensure that the data is being stored correctly and securely.
work on the security aspects of the application, such as sanitizing inputs, validating data, and preventing SQL injection attacks and all necessary security measures.
