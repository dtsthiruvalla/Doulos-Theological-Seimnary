                            At Doulos Theological Seminary, Thiruvalla, we are devoted to shaping committed servants of Christ who will passionately carry the message of the Gospel to the unreached communities across the Indian subcontinent. Our mission is rooted in the Great Commission ‚Äî to train, send, and support men and women called to make disciples and establish Christ-centered churches in places where the Gospel is yet to be heard.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a curriculum deeply anchored in the Word of God and enriched with hands-on ministry experience, we equip our students with a strong biblical foundation, practical ministry skills, and a heart for cross-cultural mission work. We believe theological education should be more than academic ‚Äî it should be transformational, igniting a lifelong commitment to Christ and His calling.
